# Image Style Transfer Using ml5 library 
This project is an application of Image Style Transfer. It is largely based on work of reiinakano and yiningshi.   

## What is Image Style Transfer?  
Image Style Transfer uses machine learning to transfer the "style" (including color and texture) of one image onto a different, content image. This and the above-mentioned projects use pretrained convolutional neural networks for image recognition. For more in-depth reading on style transfer, you can reference this [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Gatys, Ecker, Bethge, or check out these helpful articles [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/style-transfer-styling-images-with-convolutional-neural-networks-7d215b58f461) and [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/artistic-style-transfer-with-convolutional-neural-network-7ce2476039fd).
